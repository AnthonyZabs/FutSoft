# FutSoft
Automated System for the Management of Soccer 7 Tournaments. It's a school project that I did for the subject of Project Management.

## Features
✔️ User and session system.
✔️ Management of Leagues, Tournaments, Journeys, Teams, Coaches, Referees and Players.
✔️ Automatic matchmaking.
✔️ Match tracking (goals, fouls, changes and comments).
✔️ Statistical tables (Goals Table and General Table).
✔️ Team templates and player profiles.
✔️ Generation of Journeys automated (depending on the results of the previous matches taking into visit away goals).
✔️ All this is manageable from an administrative panel (with the option of adding users to the system).
